            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Du Fu (712–770), was a prominent realist poet of the Tang Dynasty. He and Li Bai are collectively known as “Li-Du,” while he is often called “Du Gongbu” or “Du Shaoling” by later generations. A native of Gong County in Henan (modern-day Henan Province), Du Fu’s poetry reflects his concern for the welfare of the people and his high moral standards. Approximately 1,400 of his poems have been preserved, which are lauded for their technical mastery and emotional depth, earning his works the title of “poetry as history.”</p>

            <h3>Thought and Style</h3>
            <p>Du Fu’s philosophical core lies in Confucian ideals of benevolent governance, which shaped his poetic themes of patriotism and compassion. His grand aspirations, especially “to elevate rulers to the legendary level of Yao and Shun,” are evident in his dedication to addressing societal suffering. His experiences during the tumultuous times of the An Lushan Rebellion deeply impacted his poetry, fostering a style marked by a melancholic resilience ("沉郁顿挫" or “solemn and rhythmic”) that resonates with the era’s struggles.</p>

            <h3>Literary Contributions</h3>
            <p>Du Fu’s poetry, renowned for its precision, extensive use of parallelism, and structural innovation, is admired for capturing the essence of social and natural imagery. From themes of turbulent rivers to solitary figures like elderly farmers, his verses reflect the people’s hardships, drawing from Confucian and humanist ethics. His later works are versatile, blending elements of grandeur, eloquence, and subtle critique, which influenced later poets. Literary critics have compared his poems to historical records due to their vivid portrayal of events, hence the moniker “poetry as history.”</p>
