            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Du Fu (712–770), was a prominent realist poet of the Tang Dynasty. He and Li Bai are collectively known as “Li-Du,” while he is often called “Du Gongbu” or “Du Shaoling” by later generations. A native of Gong County in Henan (modern-day Henan Province), Du Fu’s poetry reflects his concern for the welfare of the people and his high moral standards. Approximately 1,400 of his poems have been preserved, which are lauded for their technical mastery and emotional depth, earning his works the title of “poetry as history.”</p>

            <h3>Thought and Style</h3>
            <p>Du Fu’s philosophical core lies in Confucian ideals of benevolent governance, which shaped his poetic themes of patriotism and compassion. His grand aspirations, especially “to elevate rulers to the legendary level of Yao and Shun,” are evident in his dedication to addressing societal suffering. His experiences during the tumultuous times of the An Lushan Rebellion deeply impacted his poetry, fostering a style marked by a melancholic resilience ("沉郁顿挫" or “solemn and rhythmic”) that resonates with the era’s struggles.</p>

            <h3>Literary Contributions</h3>
            <p>Du Fu’s poetry, renowned for its precision, extensive use of parallelism, and structural innovation, is admired for capturing the essence of social and natural imagery. From themes of turbulent rivers to solitary figures like elderly farmers, his verses reflect the people’s hardships, drawing from Confucian and humanist ethics. His later works are versatile, blending elements of grandeur, eloquence, and subtle critique, which influenced later poets. Literary critics have compared his poems to historical records due to their vivid portrayal of events, hence the moniker “poetry as history.”</p>

            <h3>Influence on Future Works</h3>
            <p>Du Fu’s influence peaked during the Song Dynasty, when scholars like Su Shi and Huang Tingjian studied his stylistic complexities, while literary figures like Wang Anshi and Lu You drew inspiration from his themes of patriotism and social compassion. Later, Qing scholar Jin Shengtan praised Du alongside literary giants like Sima Qian and Wang Shifu, solidifying his status as a "six-talented writer" in Chinese classics. His legacy also extended beyond China; Du Fu’s works were translated into Korean as early as 1481, and he later became widely admired in Japan, influencing poets like Matsuo Basho.</p>
            <p>In the 20th century, Du Fu’s works gained new interpretations as symbols of nationalism and socialism, and he was praised for using language that resonated with the people. Modern Western poets, such as Kenneth Rexroth, found in Du Fu’s themes of compassion and human connection an unparalleled influence, with Rexroth ranking him among history’s greatest poets for his natural and heartfelt style.</p>
