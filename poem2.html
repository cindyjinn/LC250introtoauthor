In the evening we stopped at Shi Hao Village,
officers came at night to pressgang people.

The old man climbed the wall and fled,
the old woman opened the gate and looked.

How angrily the officers shouted,
how bitterly the woman wept.

We heard the woman go forth and say, 
"Our three sons are garrisoned at Yeh City

"One son's letter has arrived: 
the other two sons have just died in battle.

"The live one still hangs onto life, 
the dead ones are gone forever.

"There's no one else in the household, 
except for a grandson still at the breast.

"The grandson's mother has not left yet; 
she hasn't got a whole dress to wear to come outside.

"Although this old lady's strength is waning, 
Officers, I'll come with you tonight.

"I will answer the urgent He Yang draft, 
and I can still prepare the morning meal."

The night was long; we heard no more words, 
just what seemed like quiet sobbing.

In the morning when we left for the road, 
we parted with only the old man.
