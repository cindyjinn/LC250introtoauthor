In the evening we stopped at Shi Hao Village,
officers came at night to pressgang people.

The old man climbed the wall and fled,
the old woman opened the gate and looked.

How angrily the officers shouted,
how bitterly the woman wept.

We heard the woman go forth and say, 
"Our three sons are garrisoned at Yeh City

"One son's letter has arrived: 
the other two sons have just died in battle.

"The live one still hangs onto life, 
the dead ones are gone forever.

"There's no one else in the household, 
except for a grandson still at the breast.

"The grandson's mother has not left yet; 
she hasn't got a whole dress to wear to come outside.

"Although this old lady's strength is waning, 
Officers, I'll come with you tonight.

"I will answer the urgent He Yang draft, 
and I can still prepare the morning meal."

The night was long; we heard no more words, 
just what seemed like quiet sobbing.

In the morning when we left for the road, 
we parted with only the old man.

        <h2>石壕吏</h2>
        <pre>
暮投石壕村，有吏夜捉人。
老翁逾墙走，老妇出门看。
吏呼一何怒！妇啼一何苦！
听妇前致词：三男邺城戍。
一男附书至，二男新战死。
存者且偷生，死者长已矣！
室中更无人，惟有乳下孙。
有孙母未去，出入无完裙。
老妪力虽衰，请从吏夜归。
急应河阳役，犹得备晨炊。
夜久语声绝，如闻泣幽咽。
天明登前途，独与老翁别。
