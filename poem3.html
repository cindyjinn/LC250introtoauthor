        <pre>
Separation by death must finally be choked down,
but separation in life is a long anguish,

Chiang-nan is a pestilential land;
no word from you there in exile.

You have been in my dreams, old friend,
as if knowing how much I miss you.

Caught in a net,
how is it you still have wings?

I fear you are no longer mortal;
the distance to here is enormous.

When your spirit came, the maples were green;
when it went, the passes were black.

The setting moon spills light on the rafters;
for a moment I think it's your face.

The waters are deep, the waves wide;
don't let the river gods take you.

        <h2>梦李白二首-其一</h2>
        <pre>
死别已吞声，生别常恻恻。
江南瘴疠地，逐客无消息。
故人入我梦，明我长相忆。
恐非平生魂，路远不可测。
魂来枫林青，魂返关塞黑。
君今在罗网，何以有羽翼？
落月满屋梁，犹疑照颜色。
水深波浪阔，无使蛟龙得。
