        <pre>
In the high autumn skies of September 
    the wind cried out in rage，
            
Tearing offin whirls from my rooftop 
    three plies of thatch.

The thatch flew across the river，
    was strewn on the floodplain，

The high stalks tangled in tips 
    of tall forest trees，

The low ones swirled in gusts across ground
    and sank into mud puddles.

The children from the village to the south
    made a fool of me，impotent with age，

Without compunction plundered what was mine
    before my very eyes，

Brazenly took armfuls of thatch，
    ran off into the bamboo，

And I screamed lips dry and throat raw，
    but no use.

Then I made my way home，learning on staff，
    sighing to myself.

A moment later the wind calmed down，
    clouds turned dark as ink，

The autumn sky rolling and overcast，
    blacker towards sunset，

And our cotton quilts were years old
    and cold as iron，

My little boy slept poorly，
    kicked rips in them.

Above the bed the roof leaked，
    no place was dry，

And the raindrops ran down like strings，
    without a break.

1 have lived through upheavals and ruin
    and have seldom slept very well，

But have no idea how 1 shall pass
    this night of soaking.

Oh，to own a mighty mansion
    of a hundred thousand rooms，

A grcat roof for the poorest gentlemcn
    of all this world,
    a place to make them smile， 
    
A building unshaken by wind or rain，
    as solid as a mountain，

Oh, when shall I see before my eyes
    a towering roof such as this?

Then I'd accept the ruin of my own little hut
    and death by freezing.

        <h2>茅屋为秋风所破歌</h2></h2>
        <pre>
八月秋高风怒号，卷我屋上三重茅。
茅飞渡江洒江郊，高者挂罥长林梢，下者飘转沉塘坳。
南村群童欺我老无力，忍能对面为盗贼。
公然抱茅入竹去，唇焦口燥呼不得，归来倚杖自叹息。
俄顷风定云墨色，秋天漠漠向昏黑。
布衾多年冷似铁，娇儿恶卧踏里裂。
床头屋漏无干处，雨脚如麻未断绝。
自经丧乱少睡眠，长夜沾湿何由彻！
安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜！风雨不动安如山。
呜呼！何时眼前突兀见此屋，吾庐独破受冻死亦足！
