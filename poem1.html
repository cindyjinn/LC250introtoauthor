        <pre>
In the high autumn skies of September 
    the wind cried out in rage，
            
Tearing offin whirls from my rooftop 
    three plies of thatch.

The thatch flew across the river，
    was strewn on the floodplain，

The high stalks tangled in tips 
    of tall forest trees，

The low ones swirled in gusts across ground
    and sank into mud puddles.

The children from the village to the south
    made a fool of me，impotent with age，

Without compunction plundered what was mine
    before my very eyes，

Brazenly took armfuls of thatch，
    ran off into the bamboo，

And I screamed lips dry and throat raw，
    but no use.

Then I made my way home，learning on staff，
    sighing to myself.

A moment later the wind calmed down，
    clouds turned dark as ink，

The autumn sky rolling and overcast，
    blacker towards sunset，

And our cotton quilts were years old
    and cold as iron，

My little boy slept poorly，
    kicked rips in them.

Above the bed the roof leaked，
    no place was dry，

And the raindrops ran down like strings，
    without a break.

1 have lived through upheavals and ruin
    and have seldom slept very well，

But have no idea how 1 shall pass
    this night of soaking.

Oh，to own a mighty mansion
    of a hundred thousand rooms，

A grcat roof for the poorest gentlemcn
    of all this world,
    a place to make them smile， 
    
A building unshaken by wind or rain，
    as solid as a mountain，

Oh, when shall I see before my eyes
    a towering roof such as this?

Then I'd accept the ruin of my own little hut
    and death by freezing.
