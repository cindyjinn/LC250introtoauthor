        <pre>
In the eighth month autumn's high winds angrily howl,

And sweep three layers of thatch from off my house.

The straw flies over the river, where it scatters,

Some is caught and hangs high up in the treetops,

Some floats down and sinks into the ditch.

The urchins from the southern village bully me, weak as I am;

They're cruel enough to rob me to my face,

Openly, they carry the straw into the bamboo.

My mouth and lips are dry from pointless calling,

I lean again on my cane and heave a sigh.

The wind soon calms, and the clouds turn the colour of ink;

The autumn sky has turned completely black.

My ancient cotton quilt is cold as iron,

My darling children sleep badly, and kick it apart.

The roof leaks over the bed- there's nowhere dry,

The rain falls thick as hemp, and without end.

Lost amid disorder, I hardly sleep,

Wet through, how can I last the long nights!

If I could get a mansion with a thousand, ten thousand rooms,

A great shelter for all the world's scholars, together in joy,

Solid as a mountain, the elements could not move it.

Oh! If I could see this house before me,

I'd happily freeze to death in my broken hut!
