## About the Author
Du Fu 杜甫  
  
Du Fu's poetry, celebrated since the early 9th century, is widely regarded as the pinnacle of Chinese literary tradition, thanks to its diversity and enduring appeal across various eras. His work, became deeply integrated into the concept of literary value, allowing successive generations of poets and critics to find inspiration and self-reflection in his verses. Chinese critics from the Song Dynasty dubbed him the "poet-historian" for his vivid depictions of the An Lushan Rebellion, capturing historical immediacy beyond what traditional historians provided. Influenced by Confucian ideals, Du Fu used poetry to bear witness to his turbulent times. His works are often arranged chronologically, reflecting his life stages and enabling readers to explore his experiences in a structured, life-based context.  
  
In this project, I will introduce Du Fu briefly, from his early life to his literary contributions, to his influences on cultures.
